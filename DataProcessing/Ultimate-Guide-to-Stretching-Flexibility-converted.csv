Brad Walker,,,,,
What are the experts saying about the Ultimate Guide to Stretching & Flexibility? (Formally the Stretching Handbook),,,,,
"“An excellent, important guide to optimum health and peak performance. Read, learn, implement and enjoy the benefits of wellness and enhanced quality of life.”",,,,,
Dr Denis Waitley (PhD) Author & Past Chairman - US Olympic Committee,,,,,
"“Up to now, while there has been a plethora of books about, ‘How to…’ ‘The benefits of…’ exercise, there has not been much advice offered regarding stretching. I believe your book fills that gap very well.  Stretching  is  a  very  important  and  often  neglected  part  of  exercise.  I  congratulate  you  on your efforts and look forward to recommending your publication to my patients.”",,,,,
Dr John Flynn Sports Medicine Australia,,,,,
"“The  acceptance  of  the  importance  of  flexibility  and  stretching  for  sport  is  commonplace,  but appropriate and accessible information for athletes and coaches to use is  not always easy to find. The  Stretching  Handbook  is  designed  to  be  a  very  portable  and  quick  reference  for  athletes  and coaches  rather  than  an  academic  reference.  To  this  end  it  is  a  very  practical  text  with  concise chapters written in an easy-to-read manner but without being punctuated by research findings or scientific  references.  Overall,  it  is  well  laid  out,  user-friendly  and  very  suitable  for  athletes  and developing  coaches.  It  is  a  welcome  addition  to  the  limited  number  of  texts  that  deal  with stretching for sport.”",,,,,
Angela Calder Performance Consultant - Australian Institute of Sport,,,,,
"""The   Stretching   Handbook   has   given   me   a   greater   understanding   and   appreciation   of   the importance of stretching. After reading The Stretching Handbook my coach and I decided to write specific  stretching  time  into  my  program,  thus  taking  stretching  far  more  seriously.  Thanks  for allowing  me  to  read  The  Stretching  Handbook.  It  is  definitely  a  book  that  anybody  wanting  to exercise and even more so, elite athletes, should have by their side.""",,,,,
Greg Bennett World Champion Triathlete,,,,,
“The  Stretching  Handbook  provides  a  comprehensive  guide  to  the  art  of  stretching.  The  detailed photographic  catalogue  of  stretching  exercises  serves  as  an  easy-to-follow  reference  guide  for athletes and coaches alike.”,,,,,
Wayne Pearce Coach - Balmain Tigers RLFC,,,,,
"“Stretching  is  an  important  part  of  any  exercise  program  to  help  prevent  injury  and  to  increase flexibility. The Stretching Handbook is a clear, concise guide to stretches for all areas of the body.”
Bob Fulton Coach - Manly Sea Eagles RLFC & Australian Team Coach",,,,,
“The Stretching Handbook is a useful resource for all coaches. The photographs and explanations are clear and concise. A much needed resource.”,,,,,
Janet Bothwell National Director of Coaching - Netball Australian,,,,,
"“A  thoroughly  professional  and  comprehensive  book  on  a  subject  that  previously  was  very  much neglected. It will play an important  role for coaches and athletes in preparation for their specific sports. The Stretching Handbook is a must for anybody in the health and fitness industry.”
Tony Green Strength & Conditioning Coach - Gold Coast Chargers RLFC",,,,,
"“Overall  The  Stretching  Handbook  is  a  great  resource  for  coaches  and  athletes.  It  offers  a  quick and easy reference to stretches for all areas of the body. Its size is an added bonus, making it easy to fit into a bag or back pocket.”",,,,,
Jill McIntosh Coach - Australian Netball Team,,,,,
"“A comprehensive, helpful and easy-to-read publication. Great for amateurs and professionals.”
Frank Farina Australian Socceroo
Player / Coach - Brisbane Strikers",,,,,
"“As a sportsman and now in my role offering improved health and preventative health care, I see this as a very practical tool for people of all walks of life. May it encourage all people to stretch to new heights of health and well being.”",,,,,

Introduction,,,,,
"In  the  late  80’s  and  early  90’s  I  was  competing  as  a  professional  triathlete and working in the sports coaching industry. I had the pleasure of working with  a  number  of  high  profile  coaches,  athletes  and  sports  doctors,  and  I started to notice a common theme among the injured athletes that I saw: A lack of flexibility.",,,,,
"At   university   I   dedicated   a   large   portion   of   my   time   to   the   study   of stretching and flexibility training, and wherever possible chose the topic for my assignments and research papers.
Then  in  1992  I  was  fortunate  enough  to  work  with  an  exceptional  sports coach by the name of Col Stewart. Col is one of those rare coaches who can take just about any sport, and devise a specific training program that always produces outstanding improvements for  the  athlete.  His coaching is  largely responsible   for   the   success   of   many   of   his   world   champion   athletes: Including his son, Miles Stewart (World Triathlon Champion); Mick Doohan (World  500cc  Motorcycle  Champion);  and  countless  others  from  sports  as diverse as roller-skating, squash, and cycling.
During  my  time  under  his  tuition,  I  noticed  that  his  athletes  were  able  to remain  injury  free  while  sustaining  training  loads  that  would  cripple  the average athlete. And one of the keys to his athletes’ success was stretching.
I   was   convinced   that   improved   flexibility   through   the   proper   use   of stretching  was  a  key  component  to  improving  athletic  performance  and reducing susceptibility to sports injury. The problem was; I could not find a publication that was as serious about stretching as I was.
By   1995   I   had   become   frustrated   with   the   lack   of   information   about stretching and was desperately seeking a comprehensive guide to flexibility training: A book that took stretching and flexibility seriously, with a detailed list and picture of every possible sports-related stretch a person could do. In my search I found many books where stretching got a mention, but nothing more  than  a  page  or  two  of  vague  generalizations  and  a  few  stick  figures performing  some  very  basic  stretches.  So  I  decided  to  stop  searching  and start writing.",,,,,
"In  1997,  when  the  first  edition  of  the  Ultimate  Guide  to  Stretching  & Flexibility (Formally the Stretching Handbook) was released, there was only one  other  publication  entirely  dedicated  to  the  topic  of  stretching.  Today there   are   dozens,   but   the   Ultimate   Guide   to   Stretching   &   Flexibility continues  to  stand  alone  as  the  most  user-friendly  resource  on  stretching",,,,,
"and flexibility training for athletes, coaches, trainers, therapists and health care professionals.
The Ultimate Guide to Stretching & Flexibility is written as an easy-to-use, quick reference guide so you don’t have to read it from cover to cover to take advantage  of  the  information  within.  It  contains  135  unique  stretching exercises  for every muscle  group in the  body  and has been designed so  you can  carry  it  with  you  and  refer  to  it  often.  This  is  a  back-pocket  handbook not a sit-on-the-shelf text book.
If you want information on stretches for the back, look under that section; if you want to know what stretching can do for you, have a read through some of the benefits in chapter 2; or if you want to make sure you are stretching properly, refer to the Rules for Safe Stretching in chapter 5.
Whether  you  are  a  professional  athlete  or  a  fitness  enthusiast;  a  sports coach or personal trainer; a physical therapist or sports doctor, the Ultimate Guide to Stretching & Flexibility will benefit you.",,,,,

"Chapter 1
An Overview of Stretching and Flexibility",,,,,
"What is flexibility?
Flexibility  is  commonly  described  as  the  range  of  motion,  or  movement, (ROM) around a particular joint or set of joints.  In layman’s terms; how far we can reach, bend and turn.
When improving flexibility is the goal, the muscles and their fascia (sheath) should   be   the   major   focus   of   flexibility   training.   While   bones,   joints, ligaments,  tendons  and  skin  do  contribute  to  overall  flexibility,  we  have limited control over these factors.",,,,,
"What is stretching?
Stretching,  as  it  relates  to  physical  health  and  fitness,  is  the  process  of placing  particular  parts  of  the  body  into  a  position  that  will  lengthen  the muscles and their associated soft tissues.
Upon undertaking a regular stretching program a number of changes begin to  occur  within  the  body  and  specifically  within  the  muscles  themselves. Other tissues that begin to adapt to the stretching process include the fascia, tendons, skin and scar tissue.",,,,,
"Fitness and flexibility
An individuals’ physical fitness depends upon a number of components, and flexibility is only one of these. Although flexibility is a vital part of physical fitness it is important to see it as only one spoke in the fitness wheel. Other components include strength, power, speed, endurance, balance, agility, skill and co-ordination.
Although  different  sports  require  different  levels of each fitness  component it is essential to plan a regular exercise or training program that covers all the components of physical fitness.",,,,,
"Rugby   and   Gridiron   for   example,   rely   heavily   on   strength   and   power; however  the  exclusion  of  skill  drills  and  flexibility  training  could  lead  to injury   and   poor   performance.   Strength   and   flexibility   are   of   prime importance  to  a  gymnast,  but  a  balanced  training  program  would  also
improve power, speed and endurance.",,,,,
"The  same  is  true  for  each  individual,  while  some  people  may  be  naturally strong  or  flexible  it would be  foolish for such a  person to  completely ignore the  other  components  of  physical  fitness.  And  just  because  an  individual exhibits good flexibility at one joint or muscle group does not mean that the entire   individual   will   be   flexible.   Therefore,   flexibility   can   be   assessed according   to   a   specific   muscle   group,   a   specific   joint   or   the   specific requirements of a particular sport.",,,,,
"The dangers of poor flexibility
Tight,  stiff  muscles  limit  normal  range  of  motion.  In  some  cases,  a  lack  of flexibility can be a major contributing factor to muscle and joint pain. In the extreme,  a  lack  of  flexibility  can  mean  it  is  difficult,  for  example,  to  bend down or look over the shoulder.
Tight,  stiff  muscles  interfere  with  proper  muscle  action.  If  the  muscles cannot  contract  and  relax  efficiently,  decreased  performance  and  a  lack  of muscle  movement  control  will  result.  Short,  tight  muscles  can  also  cause  a loss of strength and power during physical activity.
In  a  very  small  percentage  of  cases  tight,  stiff  muscles  can  even  restrict blood  circulation.  Good  blood  circulation  is  vitally  important  to  ensure  the muscles receive adequate amounts of oxygen and nutrients. Poor circulation can result in increased muscle fatigue and ultimately, the ability to recover from strenuous exercise and the muscles repair process is impeded.",,,,,
Any one of these factors can greatly increase the chance of becoming injured. Together they present a package  that includes muscular discomfort; loss of performance; an increased risk of soft tissue injury; and a greater likelihood of repeated injury.,,,,,
"How is flexibility restricted?
The  muscular system  needs to  be  flexible  to  achieve  peak performance  and stretching  is  the  most  effective  way  of  developing  and  retaining  flexible muscles and joints. However, a number of other factors also contribute to a decrease in flexibility.",,,,,
"Flexibility,  or  range   of  motion,   can  be   restricted  by  both   internal  and external  factors.  Internal  factors  such  as  bones,  ligaments,  muscle  bulk, muscle length, tendons and skin all restrict the amount of movement at any particular  joint.  As  an  example,  the  human  leg  cannot  extend  forward beyond   a   straight   position   because   of   the   structure   of   the   bones   and ligaments that make up the knee joint.",,,,,
"External factors such as age, gender, temperature, restrictive clothing and of course any injury or disability will also have an effect on ones flexibility.",,,,,
"Flexibility and the aging process
It is no secret that with each passing year muscles and joints become  more stiff  and  tight.  This  is  part  of  the  ageing  process  and  is  caused  by  a combination  of  physical  degeneration  and  inactivity.  Although  we  cannot halt the aging process completely, this should not mean giving up on trying to improve flexibility and fitness.
Age  should  not  be  an  excuse  that  prevents  one  from  living  a  fit  and  active lifestyle,  but  certain  precautions  should be  taken  as  we get  older.  (Refer  to the Rules for Safe Stretching in chapter 5 for more information.)",,,,,
"Chapter 2
The Benefits of Stretching",,,,,
"Stretching  is  a  simple  and  effective  activity  that  helps  to  enhance  athletic performance,  decrease  the  likelihood  of  sports  injury  and  minimize  muscle soreness. But how specifically is this accomplished?",,,,,
"Improved range of motion (ROM)
By  placing  particular  parts  of  the  body  in  certain  positions,  we  are  able  to increase  the  length  of  the  muscles  and  their  associated  soft  tissues.  As  a result of this, a reduction in general muscle tension is achieved and range of motion is increased.
By increasing range of motion we are increasing the distance our limbs can move  before  damage  occurs  to  the  muscles  and   other  soft  tissues.  For example, the muscles and tendons in the back of the legs are put under great strain  when  kicking  a  ball.  Therefore,  the  more  flexible  and  pliable  those muscles  are,  the  greater  the  range  of  motion  and  the  further  the  leg  can travel forward before a strain or injury occurs to them.",,,,,
The  benefits  of  an  extended  range  of  motion  include:  increased  comfort;  a greater  ability  to  move  freely;  and  a  lessening  of  the  susceptibility  to  soft tissue injuries like muscle and tendon strains.,,,,,
"Increased power
There is a dangerous stretching myth that says, if you stretch too much you will  lose  both  joint  stability  and  muscle  power.  This  is  untrue,  (as  long  as The  Rules  for  Safe  Stretching  in  chapter  5  are  observed).  By  increasing muscle  length  and  range  of  motion  we  are  increasing  the  distance  over which the muscles are able to contract. This results in a potential increase to the muscles power and therefore increases athletic ability, while also leading to an improvement in dynamic balance, or the ability to control the muscles.",,,,,
"Reduced delayed onset muscle soreness
Most have experienced what happens when we go for a run or to the gym for the  first  time  after  an  extended  break.  The  following  day  the  muscles  are tight, sore, stiff, and it is usually hard to even walk down a flight of stairs. This   soreness   that   usually   accompanies   strenuous   physical   activity   is referred  to  as  delayed  onset  muscle  soreness  (DOMS).  This  soreness  is  the",,,,,
"result of micro  tears, (minute  tears within the muscle  fibers), blood pooling and  accumulated  waste  products,  such  as  lactic  acid.  Stretching,  as  part  of an  effective  cool-down,  helps  to  alleviate  this  soreness  by  lengthening  the individual  muscle  fibers;  increasing  blood  circulation;  and  removing  waste products.",,,,,
"Reduced fatigue
Fatigue  is  a  major  problem  for  everyone,  especially  those  who  exercise.  It results  in  a  decrease  in  both  physical  and  mental  performance.  Increased flexibility  through  stretching  can  help  prevent  the  effects  of  fatigue  by taking pressure off the working muscles, (the agonist).",,,,,
"For  every  muscle  in  the  body  there  is  an  opposite  or  opposing  muscle,  (the antagonist). If the opposing muscles are more flexible, the working muscles do not have to exert as much force against the opposing muscles. Therefore each movement of the working muscles actually takes less effort.",,,,,
"Added benefits
Along with the benefits listed above, a regular stretching program will also help  to  improve  posture;  develop  body  awareness;  improve  co-ordination; promote  circulation;  increase  energy;  and  improve  relaxation  and  stress relief.",,,,,
"Why is there so much confusion about stretching?
If  improving  flexibility  will  result  in  all  the  benefits  listed  above,  why  is  it common to hear reports that say; stretching should be avoided?
The study of stretching and flexibility training really has a long way to go. If someone  told  the  average  sports  coach  or  personal  trainer  that  bicep  curls are the best exercise; the reply would be “please explain!” The best for what? The  best  for whom?  What  type  of  bicep  curl?  And  when are  they  the best? The person making this sort of claim would be dismissed as ignorant and un- learned.",,,,,
"But these are the same sort of statements that I hear about stretching every day.  And  the  problem  is;  that  same  sports  coach  or  personal  trainer  who questioned the statement about bicep curls; accepts by blind faith that these statements about stretching are true, without giving them a second thought.
Statements like: The best type of stretching is dynamic stretching. Never do this stretch. This is the best stretch. Don’t stretch before exercise.",,,,,
"These ridiculous statements are causing a lot of confusion about the topic of stretching and causing some people to abandon stretching altogether.
These  unqualified  statements,  like  the  ones  above,  should  not  be  made without fully disclosing all the parameters involved. For example, I recently heard  a  lecturer  make  the  comment…  “The best  time  to stretch  is  2 hours after exercise.” This statement needs to be questioned.
Stretch for what: To improve flexibility; to improve recovery; to avoid injury? And  for  whom:  For  athletes;  for  sedentary  people;  for  those  looking  to improve  flexibility;  for  those  looking  to  improve  performance;  for  someone recovering from an injury? And what type of stretching is he talking about: Static stretching; PNF stretching; dynamic stretching; AI stretching?
A  new  level  of  professionalism  is  required  for  the  topic  of  stretching  and flexibility  training.  The  professionalism  and  competency  of  the  strength training industry has developed monumentally over the last 20 years and it is time that the flexibility industry does the same. More questions need to be asked  and  current  theories  need  to  be  expanded  and  explained  in  more detail.
The bottom line is: Stretching is beneficial, when used correctly. Remember, stretching  is  just  one  very  important  component  that  assists  to  reduce  the risk   of   injury   and   improve   athletic   performance.   The   best   results   are achieved when stretching is used in combination with other injury reduction techniques and conditioning exercises.",,,,,
"Stretching is not a quick fix
Even with all the benefits listed earlier, stretching is not a quick fix. No one is  going  to  do  a  few  stretches  before  they  exercise  and  magically  become  a better athlete or totally resilient to injury.
Just the same as doing three sets of lunges before playing basketball will not make  someone  a better basketball  player, or doing three sets of bicep curls before  playing  tennis  will  not  make  them  a  better  tennis  player,  the  same applies to stretching. Doing three sets of hamstring stretches before running onto the sports field will do very little, if anything for anyone.
This is where a number of recent studies have fallen short. In an attempt to measure  the  benefits of stretching, researchers have  tried to  use stretching in  the  same  way  as  the  examples  above.  They  have  tried  to  measure  the effects of doing a few stretches before playing sport, and when the results of their  research  suggest  that  no  benefit  was  gained,  they  make  the  wrong assumption that stretching is a waste of time.",,,,,
"Stretching was never meant to be used in this way, and if anyone makes the claim  that doing a few stretches before  you exercise will make  you a better athlete or less susceptible to injury, they are incorrect.
The  benefits  of  stretching  are  only  attained  when  flexibility  training  is applied  professionally  and  diligently  over  an  extended  period  of  time;  just the  same  as  a  weight  loss  program,  or  strength  training  program.  No  one expects  to  lose  weight  after  eating  one  healthy  meal,  or  grow  big  muscles after doing one workout in the gym.
Stretching is beneficial, when used correctly.",,,,,
A Stretching Story,,,,,
"Chapter 3
A Stretching Story",,,,,
"Once  upon  a  time  there  was  an  eager,  young  athlete  ready  to  take  on  the world.  He  trained  hard,  ate  right,  got  lots  of  rest  and  did  all  the  things  a budding young athlete should do.
His  specialty  was  the  10  km  run  and  he  was  quite  good  too.  His  personal best was 32 minutes and 4 seconds, which is pretty good for a seventeen year old   kid.   But   he   longed   to   break   the   30   minute   barrier;   he   had   tried everything but nothing seemed to work.
His  training  program  was  well  structured  and  very  professional.  He  was disciplined   and   rarely   wavered   from   his   set   training    schedule.   He incorporated long runs, tempo runs, interval training, weight training in the gym,  hill  running,  cross  country  running,  deep  water  running  and  various other training methods to try and improve his personal best. He even bought a mountain bike to introduce cross training into his program.
He  always  ate  right,  took  extra  vitamins  and  minerals  to  supplement  his diet and always made sure that he drank plenty of water. He made sure he was well rested and even got the occasional massage to help his legs recover.
I met our budding young athlete at a local fun-run where he had a good race and achieved a time that most people would be happy with. Although it was close  to  his personal  best, it was still nowhere  near his goal of breaking 30 minutes.",,,,,
"We  got  to  talking  and  I  could  tell  he  was  disheartened  and  frustrated.  He explained to me that he had tried everything and nothing he did seemed to improve his personal best. I asked if he would mind if I attended one of his training sessions and he welcomed the idea of getting some fresh advice.
As it turned out, the next session that I could get to was an interval session at the local 400 meter track. As I arrived he was just finishing his warm-up with  a  few  run-throughs.  For  this  session  he  was  doing  eight,  400  meter intervals with plenty of rest in between each one.
As  soon  as  he  started  the  first  interval  I  could  tell  what  was  wrong.  His hamstring  and  hip  muscles  were  so  tight  that  they  restricted  the  normal range  of  motion  of  his  legs  to  the  extent  that  they  shortened  his  stride length. For a tall guy with long legs his stride length was atrociously short.",,,,,
"After he finished his cool-down I asked him if he ever did any stretching. He replied quite honestly by saying he did none at all. Just to be sure we did a few  flexibility  tests  for  his  back,  hamstrings  and  calves.  From  these  it  was quite obvious that his flexibility was a major limiting factor in achieving his goal.",,,,,
"I   went  on   to   explain  how  his  lack  of  flexibility  was  contributing  to  a shortened stride length, which in turn was making it difficult to improve his personal  best  time.  Armed  with  this  new  bit  of  hope  he  eagerly  wanted advice on how to incorporate stretching into his training program.
We  sat  down  together  and  reviewed  his  training  program  for  the  next  two weeks.  We  decided  not  to  make  any  changes  to  the  program  itself,  but simply add  a  general  stretching  workout  to  each session. The  only advice  I gave  him  was  to  add  a  few  minutes  of  dynamic  stretching  before  each training  session,  add  another  15  minutes  of  static  stretching  after  each session and at least 30 minutes of static stretching before going to bed each night.",,,,,
"The results did not happen straight away, but within two weeks his general flexibility improved considerably. We then incorporated a number of specific stretches to further increase the flexibility of his back, hamstrings, hips and calves.
The  improvements  over  the  next  couple  of  months  were  remarkable.  Not only   did   his   times   improve   but   his   running   style   and   technique   also improved considerably.
The  last  time  I  spoke  with  our  budding  young  athlete  he  still  had  not achieved  his  30  minute  goal,  but  his  400  meter  time  had  dropped  to  less than 60 seconds. His 5 km personal best was right on 15 minutes and his 10 km personal best was now just under 31 minutes. I am positive it is only a matter of time before he achieves his goal of breaking 30 minutes for 10 km.
Remember,  that  except  for  adding  stretching  to  his  program,  nothing  else changed.  We  did  not  add  anything  to  his  program  and  we  did  not  take anything  away. All  we  did  was  incorporate  a  few  basic stretching  exercises as a regular part of his training and the results were remarkable.
Do not make the mistake of thinking that something as simple as stretching will  not  be  effective. Stretching  is  a  vital  part  of any exercise  program  and should be looked upon as being as important as any other part of your health and fitness.",,,,,
"Chapter 4
The Types of Stretching",,,,,
"Stretching is slightly more technical than swinging a leg over a park bench. There  are  methods  and  techniques  that  will  maximize  the  benefits  and minimize the risk of injury. In this chapter we will look at the different types of  stretching,  the  particular  benefits,  risks  and  uses,  plus  a  description  of how each type is performed.",,,,,
"Just as there are many different ways to strength train, there are also many different  ways  to  stretch.  However,  it  is  important  to  note  that  although there  are  many  different  ways  to  stretch,  no  one  way,  or  no  one  type  of stretching  is  better  than  another.  Each  type  has  its  own  advantages  and disadvantages, and the key to getting the most out of stretching lies in being able to match the right type of stretching to the purpose, or goal trying to be achieved.
For example; PNF and passive  stretching are  great for creating permanent improvements in flexibility, but they are not very useful for warming up or preparing  the  body  for  activity.  Dynamic  stretching,  on  the  other  hand,  is great  for  warming  up  but  can  be  dangerous  if  used  in  the  initial  stages  of injury rehabilitation.
Although there are many different ways to stretch, they can all be grouped into one of two categories; static or dynamic.",,,,,
Static Stretches,,,,,
"The  term  static  stretches  refers  to  stretching  exercises  that  are  performed without  movement.  In  other  words,  the  individual  gets  into  the  stretch position and holds the stretch for a specific amount of time. Listed below are five different types of static stretching exercises.",,,,,
"Static Stretching
Static  stretching  is  performed  by  placing  the  body  into  a  position  whereby the  muscle  (or group of muscles)  to  be  stretched is under tension. Both the antagonist,  or  opposing  muscle  group  and  the  agonist,  or  muscles  to  be stretched  are  relaxed.  Then  slowly  and  cautiously  the  body  is  moved  to increase  the  tension  on  the  stretched  muscle  (or  group  of  muscles).  At  this point  the  position  is  held  or  maintained  to  allow  the  muscles  to  relax  and lengthen.",,,,,
The   stretch   to   the   right   is   a classic example of a static stretch in   which   the   opposing   muscles and    the    hamstring    and    back muscles are relaxed.,,,,,
,,,,,
"A minimum hold time of about 20 seconds    is    required     for    the muscles   to   relax   and   start   to lengthen,      while      diminishing returns  are  experienced  after  45 to 60 seconds.",,,,,
Static stretching is a very safe and effective form of stretching with a limited threat of injury. It is a good choice for beginners and sedentary individuals.,,,,,
"Passive (or Assisted) Stretching
This form of stretching is very similar to static  stretching; however another person or apparatus is used to help further stretch the muscles. Due to the greater  force  applied to  the  muscles,  this  form  of stretching  can  be  slightly more  hazardous.  Therefore  it  is  very  important  that any apparatus  used is both solid and stable. When using a partner it is imperative that no jerky or bouncing  force  is  applied  to  the  stretched  muscles.  So,  choose  a  partner carefully; the partner is responsible for the safety of the muscles and joints while you are performing the stretching exercises.
The   stretch   on   the   left   is   an example  of  a  passive  stretch  in which a partner is used to stretch the chest and shoulder muscles.",,,,,
,,,,,
"Passive   stretching   is   useful   in helping to attain a greater range of  motion,  but  carries  with  it  a slightly  higher  risk  of  injury.  It can   also   be   used   effectively   as part  of  a  rehabilitation  program or as part of a cool-down.",,,,,
"Active Stretching
Active   stretching   is   performed   without   any   aid   or   assistance   from   an external force. This form of stretching involves using only the strength of the",,,,,
"opposing muscles (antagonist) to generate a stretch within the target muscle group  (agonist).  The  contraction  of  the  opposing  muscles  helps  to  relax  the stretched muscles.
A  classic  example  of  an  active  stretch  is  one where an individual raises one leg straight out in    front,    as    high    as    possible,    and    then maintains   that   fixed   position   without   any assistance from a partner or object.
Active  stretching  is  useful  as  a  rehabilitation tool and very effective as a form of conditioning before   moving   onto   dynamic   stretches.   This type   of   stretching   exercise   is   usually   quite difficult  to  hold  and  maintain  for  long  periods of  time  and  therefore  the  stretch  position  is usually only held for 10 to 15 seconds.",,,,,
,,,,,
"PNF Stretching
PNF   stretching   (Proprioceptive   Neuromuscular   Facilitation),   sometimes referred  to  as  Facilitated Stretching,  is  a  more  advanced  form  of  flexibility training  that  involves  both  the  stretching  and  contracting  of  the  muscle group being targeted. PNF stretching was originally developed as a form of rehabilitation and for that function it is very effective. It is also excellent for targeting specific muscle groups, and as well as increasing flexibility, it also improves muscular strength.
There  are  many  different  variations  of  the  PNF  stretching  principle  and sometimes   it   is   referred   to   as   Contract-Relax  stretching   or   Hold-Relax stretching. Post Isometric Relaxation (PIR) is another variation of the PNF technique.
To  perform  a  PNF  stretch,  the area to be stretched is positioned so  that  the  muscle  (or  group  of muscles)   is   under   tension.   The individual    then    contracts    the stretched muscle group for 5 to 6 seconds    while    a    partner    (or immovable        object)        applies sufficient   resistance   to   inhibit movement.        The        force       of contraction  should  be  relative  to the   level   of   conditioning.   The",,,,,
,,,,,
"contracted   muscle   group   is   then   relaxed   and   a   controlled   stretch   is immediately  applied  for  about  30  seconds.  The  athlete  is  then  allowed  30 seconds to recover and the process is repeated 2 to 4 times.
Information    differs    slightly    about    timing    recommendations    for    PNF stretching. Although there are conflicting responses to the questions; for how long  should  I  contract  the  muscle  group  and  for  how  long  should  I  rest between each stretch, it is my professional opinion, that through a study of research    literature    and    personal    experience,    the     previous    timing recommendations provide the maximum benefits from PNF stretching.",,,,,
"Isometric Stretching
Isometric   stretching   is   a   form   of   passive   stretching   similar   to   PNF stretching,   but   the   contractions   are   held   for   a   longer   period   of   time. Isometric  stretching  places  high  demands  on  the  stretched  muscles  and  is not  recommended  for  children  or  adolescents  who  are  still  growing.  Other recommendations include  allowing at least 48 hours rest between isometric stretching  sessions  and  performing  only  one  isometric  stretching  exercise per muscle group in a session.
A  classic  example  of  how  isometric  stretching is  used  is  the  Leaning  Heel-back  Calf  Stretch to  the  right.  In  this  stretch  the  participant stands  upright,  leans  forward  towards  a  wall and then places one foot as far from the wall as is comfortable while making sure that the heel remains  on  the  ground.  In  this  position,  the participant   contracts   the   calf   muscles   as   if trying to raise the heel off the ground.",,,,,
,,,,,
"To  perform  an  isometric  stretch;  assume  the position    of    the    passive    stretch    and    then contract   the   stretched   muscle   for   10   to   15 seconds. Be sure that all movement of the limb
is  prevented. Then relax the muscle  for at least 20 seconds. This procedure should be repeated 2 to 5 times.",,,,,
Dynamic Stretches,,,,,
"The term dynamic stretches refers to stretching exercises that are performed with movement. In other words, the individual uses a swinging or bouncing movement  to  extend  their  range  of  motion  and  flexibility.  Listed  below  are four different types of dynamic stretching exercises.",,,,,
"Ballistic Stretching
Ballistic  stretching  is  an  outdated  form  of  stretching  that  uses  momentum generated by rapid swinging, bouncing and rebounding movements to force a body part past its normal range of motion.",,,,,
"The   risks   associated   with   ballistic   stretching   far   outweigh   the   gains, especially  when  greater  gains  can  be  achieved  by  using  other  forms  of stretching like dynamic stretching and PNF stretching. Other than potential injury, the  main disadvantage  of ballistic stretching is that it fails to  allow the stretched muscle time to adapt to the stretched position and instead may cause  the  muscle  to  tighten  up  by  repeatedly  triggering  the  stretch  reflex, (discussed in chapter 5).",,,,,
"Dynamic Stretching
Unlike ballistic stretching, dynamic stretching uses   a   controlled,   soft   bounce   or   swinging movement  to  move  a  particular  body  part  to the limit of its range of motion. The force of the bounce   or   swing   is   gradually   increased   but should never become radical or uncontrolled.
Do    not    confuse    dynamic    stretching    with ballistic    stretching.    Dynamic    stretching    is slow,  gentle  and  very  purposeful.  At  no  time during  dynamic  stretching  should  a  body  part be   forced   past   the   joints   normal   range   of motion. Ballistic stretching, on the other hand, is  much  more  aggressive  and  its  very  purpose
is to force the body part beyond the limit of its normal range of motion.",,,,,
,,,,,
"Active Isolated Stretching
Active isolated (AI) stretching is a form of stretching developed by Aaron L. Mattes,  and  is  sometimes  referred  to  as  The  Mattes  Method.  It  works  by contracting  the  antagonist,  or  opposing  muscle  group,  which  forces  the",,,,,
"stretched muscle group to relax. The procedure for performing an AI stretch is as follows.
1. Choose the muscle group to be stretched   and   then   get   into   a position to begin the stretch.
2.        Actively        contract        the antagonist,   or   opposing   muscle group.
3.  Move  into  the  stretch  quickly and smoothly.
4.  Hold  for  1  to  2  seconds  and then release the stretch.
5. Repeat 5 to 10 times.
While AI stretching certainly has some benefits (mainly for the professional or well conditioned athlete), it also has a number of unsubstantiated claims. One  such  claim  is  that  AI  stretching  does  not  engage  the  stretch  reflex  (or myotatic reflex) because the stretch is only held for 2 seconds or less.1,2  This however, defies basic muscle physiology. The stretch reflex in the calf muscle for example is triggered within 3 hundredths of a second, so any claim that AI stretching can somehow bypass or outsmart the stretch reflex is nothing more than wishful thinking.",,,,,
,,,,,
"Resistance Stretching and Loaded Stretching
Resistance   stretching   and   loaded   stretching   are   a   form   of   dynamic stretching that both contract and lengthen a muscle at the same time. They work by stretching a muscle group through its entire range of motion while under  contraction.  For  this  reason,  both  resistance  stretching  and  loaded stretching  are  as  much  about  strengthening  a  muscle  group  as  they  are about stretching it.
Like  AI  stretching  above,  resistance  stretching  and  loaded  stretching  do have  their  benefits.  Five  time  Olympic  swimmer,  Dara  Torres  credits  a portion   of   her   swimming   success   to   the   use   of   resistance   stretching. However,  these  forms  of  stretching  place  high  demands  on  the  musculo- skeletal system and are therefore only recommended for professional or well conditioned athletes.",,,,,

"Chapter 5
The Rules for Safe Stretching",,,,,
"As  with  most  activities  there  are  rules  and  guidelines  to  ensure  that  they are safe. Stretching is no exception. Stretching can be extremely dangerous and  harmful  if  done  incorrectly.  It  is  vitally  important  that  the  following rules be adhered to, both for safety and for maximizing the potential benefits of stretching.
There  is  often  confusion  and  concerns  about  which  stretches  are  good  and which  stretches  are  bad.  In  most  cases  someone  has  told  the  inquirer  that they should not do this stretch or that stretch, or that this is a “good” stretch and this is a “bad” stretch.
Are there only good stretches and bad stretches? Is there no middle ground? And if there are only good and bad stretches, how do we decide which  ones are  good  and  which  ones  are  bad?  Let  us  put  an  end  to  the  confusion  once and for all.",,,,,
"There is no such thing as a good or bad stretch!
Just  as  there  are  no  good  or  bad  exercises,  there  are  no  good  or  bad stretches;  only  what  is  appropriate  for  the  specific  requirements  of  the individual.  So  a  stretch  that  is  perfectly  safe  and  beneficial  for  one  person may not be safe or beneficial for someone else.
Let  us  use  an  example.  A  person  with  a  shoulder  injury  would  not  be expected to do push-ups or freestyle swimming, but that does not mean that these are  bad exercises. Now, consider the same  scenario  from  a stretching point  of  view.  That  same  person  should  avoid  shoulder  stretches,  but  that does not mean that all shoulder stretches are bad.
The  stretch  itself  is  neither  good  nor  bad.  It  is  the  way  the  stretch  is performed   and   whom   it   is   performed   on   that   makes   stretching   either effective  and  safe,  or  ineffective  and  harmful.  To  place  a  particular  stretch into  the  category  of  “good”  or  “bad”  is  foolish  and  dangerous.  To  label  a stretch  as  “good”  gives  people  the  false  impression  that  they  can  do  that stretch  whenever  and  however  they  want  and  it  will  not  cause  them  any harm or injury, which is misleading and dangerous.",,,,,
"The specific requirements of the individual are what are important! Remember,  stretches  are  neither  good  nor  bad.  However,  when  choosing  a stretch  there  are  a  number  of  precautions  and  checks  that  need  to  be performed before giving that stretch the okay.
1.     Firstly,  make  a  general  review  of  the  individual.  Are  they  healthy and   physically   active,   or   have   they   been   leading   a   sedentary lifestyle  for  the  past  5  years?  Are  they  a  professional  athlete?  Are they recovering from a serious injury? Do they have aches, pains or muscle and joint stiffness in any area of their body?
2.     Secondly, make a specific review of the area, or muscle group to be stretched.  Are  the  muscles  healthy?  Is  there  any  damage  to  the joints, ligaments, tendons, etc.? Has the area been injured recently, or is it still recovering from an injury?
If  the  muscle  group  being  stretched  is  not  100%  healthy,  avoid  stretching that  area  altogether.  Work  on  recovery  and  rehabilitation  before  moving onto  specific  stretching  exercises.  If  however,  the  individual  is  healthy  and the  area  to  be  stretched  is  free  from  injury,  then  apply  the  following  rules and guidelines to all stretches.",,,,,
"Warm-up prior to stretching
This  first  rule  is  often  overlooked  and  can  lead  to  serious  injury  if  not performed effectively. Trying to stretch muscles that have not been warmed, is like trying to stretch old, dry rubber bands; they may snap.
Warming  up  prior  to  stretching  does  a  number  of  beneficial  things,  but primarily  its  purpose  is  to  prepare  the  body  and  mind  for  more  strenuous activity.  One  of  the  ways  it  achieves  this  is  by  increasing  the  body's  core temperature  while  also  increasing  the  body's  muscle  temperature.   This helps  to  make  the  muscles  loose,  supple  and  pliable,  and  is  essential  to ensure the maximum benefits are gained from stretching.
A  correct  warm-up  also  has  the  effect  of  increasing  both  heart  rate  and respiratory  rate.  This  increases  blood  flow,  which  in  turn  increases  the delivery  of  oxygen  and  nutrients  to  the  working  muscles.  All  this  helps  to prepare the muscles for stretching.
A  correct  warm-up  should  consist  of  light  physical  activity,  like  walking, jogging or easy aerobics. Both the intensity and duration of the warm-up (or how  hard  and  how  long),  should  be  governed  by  the  fitness  level  of  the participating  athlete,  although  a  correct  warm-up  for  most  people  should take about five to ten minutes and result in a light sweat.",,,,,
"For more information about stretching and the warm-up, refer to How to use Stretching as part of the Warm-up in chapter 6.",,,,,
"Stretch before and after exercise
The  question  often  arises:  Should I stretch before or after exercise?  This  is not an either / or situation; both are essential. It is no good stretching after exercise   and   counting   that   as   the   pre-exercise   stretch   for   next   time. Stretching after exercise has a totally different purpose to stretching before exercise.
The  purpose  of  stretching  before  exercise  is  to  prepare  the  individual  for activity  and  help  prevent  injury.  Stretching  does  this  by  lengthening  the muscles and associated soft tissues, which in turn increases range of motion. This  ensures  that  we  are  able  to  move  freely  without  restriction  or  injury occurring.
However,  stretching  after  exercise  has  a  very  different  role.  Its  purpose  is primarily to aid in the repair and recovery of the muscles and associated soft tissues.   By   lengthening   the   muscles,   stretching   helps   to   prevent   tight muscles   and   delayed   onset   muscle   soreness   (DOMS)   that   sometimes accompanies strenuous exercise.
After  exercise  stretching  should  be  done  as  part  of  a  cool-down.  The  cool- down   will   vary   depending   on   the   duration   and   intensity   of   exercise undertaken,  but  will  usually  consist  of  five  to  ten  minutes  of  very  light physical  activity  and  be  followed  by  five  to  ten minutes of  static  stretching exercises.
An  effective  cool-down  involving  light  physical  activity  and  stretching  will help  to:  rid  waste  products  from  the  muscles;  prevent  blood  pooling;  and promote  the  delivery of oxygen and nutrients to  the muscles. All  this  helps to return the body to a pre-exercise level, thus aiding the recovery process.",,,,,
"Stretch all major muscles and their opposing muscle groups
When  stretching,  it  is  vitally  important  that  attention  is  paid  to  all  the major muscle groups in the body. Just because a particular sport places a lot of emphasis on the legs, for example, does not mean that one can neglect the muscles of the upper body in a stretching routine.
All  the  muscles  play  an  important  role  in  any  physical  activity,  not  just  a select few. Muscles in the upper body, for example, are extremely important in  any  running  sport.  They  play  a  vital  role  in  the  stability  and  balance  of the body during the running motion. Therefore it is important to keep them",,,,,
"both flexible and supple.
Every  muscle  in  the  body  has  an  opposing  muscle  that  acts  against  it.  For example, the muscles in the front of the leg, (the quadriceps) are opposed by the  muscles  in  the  back  of  the  leg,  (the  hamstrings).  These  two  groups  of muscles  provide  a  resistance  to  each  other  that  balance  the  body.  If  one group of muscles becomes stronger or more flexible than the other group, it is likely to lead to imbalances that can result in injury or postural problems.
For example, hamstring tears are a common injury in most running sports. They are often caused by strong quadriceps and weak, inflexible hamstrings. This  imbalance  puts  a  great  deal  of  pressure  on  the  hamstrings  and  can result in a muscle tear or strain.
The  same  principle  applies  to  the  left  and  right  sides  of  the  body.  Some sports and activities place more emphasis on one side of the body, which can result in differing levels of flexibility from one side of the body to the other.
For  example,  baseball  pitchers  often  develop  an  imbalance  between  their pitching  arm  and  their  non  pitching  arm.  Typically  the  pitching  arm  and shoulder   become   stronger   and   tighter   than   the   non   pitching   arm   and shoulder.  This  can  lead  to  uneven  forces  that  pull  on  the  cervical  and thoracic  regions  of  the  spine,  resulting  in  abnormal  curvature,  which  can increase the likelihood of injuries to the neck, upper back and shoulders.",,,,,
"Stretch gently and slowly
Stretching  gently  and  slowly  helps  to  relax  the  muscles,  which  in  turn makes  stretching  more  pleasurable  and  beneficial.  This  will  also  help  to avoid   muscle   tears   and   strains   that   can   be   caused   by   rapid,   jerky movements.",,,,,
"Stretch ONLY to the point of tension
Stretching  is  NOT  an  activity  that  is  meant  to  be  painful;  it  should  be pleasurable, relaxing and very beneficial. Although many people believe that to get the most from their stretching they need to be in constant pain. This is one  of  the  greatest  mistakes  that  can  be  made  when  stretching.  Let  me explain why.
When  the  muscles  are  stretched  to  the  point  of  pain,  the  body  employs  a defense mechanism called the  stretch reflex (or myotatic reflex). This is the body’s  safety  measure  to  prevent  serious  damage  occurring  to  the  muscles, tendons  and  joints.  The  stretch  reflex  protects  the  muscles  and  tendons  by contracting them, thereby preventing them from being stretched.",,,,,
"So  to  avoid  the  stretch  reflex,  avoid  pain.  Never  push  the  stretch  beyond what  is  comfortable.  Only  stretch  to  the  point  where  tension  can  be  felt  in the  muscles.  This  way,  injury  will  be  avoided  and  the  maximum  benefits from stretching will be achieved.",,,,,
"Breathe slowly and easily while stretching
Many  people  unconsciously  hold  their  breath  while  stretching.  This  causes tension  in  the  muscles,  which  in  turn  makes  it  very  difficult  to  stretch.  To avoid  this,  remember  to  breathe  slowly  and  deeply  during  all  stretching exercises. This helps to relax the muscles, promotes blood flow and increases the delivery of oxygen and nutrients to the muscles.",,,,,
"An example
By taking a look at one of the  most controversial  stretches ever performed, we can see how the above rules are applied.",,,,,
"The  stretch  below  causes  a  negative  response  from  many  people.  It  has  a reputation as a dangerous, bad stretch and should be avoided at all costs.
So  why  is  it  that  at  every  Olympic  Games,  Commonwealth  Games  and World Championships, sprinters can be  seen doing this stretch before their events? Let us apply the above checks to find out.",,,,,
"Firstly,   consider   the   person   performing   the stretch.  Are  they  healthy,  fit  and  physically active? If not, this is not a stretch they should be doing. Are they elderly, overweight or unfit? Are they young and still growing? Do they lead a  sedentary  lifestyle?  If  so,  they  should  avoid this stretch.
This   first   consideration   alone   would   most likely   prohibit   25%   of   the   population   from doing this stretch.",,,,,
,,,,,
"Secondly, review the area to be stretched. This stretch  obviously  places  a  large  strain  on  the
muscles  of  the  hamstrings  and  lower  back,  so  if  the  hamstrings  or  lower back are not 100% healthy, do not do this stretch.
With  the  high  occurrence  of  back  pain  among  the  population,  this  second consideration could easily rule out another 50%, which means this stretch is",,,,,
"only   suitable   for   about   25%   of   the   population.   Or,   the   well   trained, physically fit, injury free athlete. Then apply the six precautions above and the  well  trained,  physically  fit,  injury  free  athlete  can  perform  this  stretch safely and effectively.
Remember,  the  stretch  itself  is  neither  good,  nor  bad.  It  is  the  way  the
stretch  is  performed  and  whom  it  is  performed  on  that  makes  stretching either effective and safe, or ineffective and harmful.",,,,,

How to Stretch Properly",,,,,
"When to stretch?
Stretching  needs  to  be  as  important  as  the  rest  of  our  training.  If  we  are involved in any competitive type of sport or exercise then it is crucial that we make time for specific stretching workouts. Set time aside to work on muscle groups  that  are  tight or  especially  important  for your  particular  sport.  The more involved and committed we are to exercise and fitness, the more time and effort we will need to commit to stretching.
As  discussed  in  chapter  5  it  is  important  to  stretch  both  before  and  after exercise,  but  when  else  should  we  stretch?  Stretch  periodically  throughout the entire day. It is a great way to  stay loose and to help ease the stress of everyday  life.  One  of  the  most  productive  ways  to  utilize  time  is  to  stretch while watching television. Start with five minutes of marching or jogging on the  spot  then  take  a  seat  on  the  floor  in  front  of  the  television  and  start stretching.
Competition is a time when great demands are placed on the body; therefore it  is  vitally  important  that  we  are  in  peak  physical  condition.  Flexibility should  be  at  its  best  just  before  competition.  Too  many  injuries  are  caused by  the  sudden  exertion  that  is  needed  for  competitive  sport.  Get  strict  on stretching before competition.",,,,,
"What type of stretching?
Choosing  the  right  type  of  stretching  for  the  right  purpose  will  make  a big difference  to  the  effectiveness  of  any  flexibility  training  program.  To  follow are  some  suggestions  for  when  to  use  the  different  types  of  stretches.  (For more detailed information refer to chapter 4.)
For warming up, dynamic stretching is the  most effective, while  for cooling down,  static,  passive  and  PNF  stretching  are  best.  For  improving  range  of motion,    try    PNF    and    Active    Isolated    stretching,    and    for    injury rehabilitation,  a  combination  of  PNF,  Isometric  and  Active  stretching  will give the best results.",,,,,
"Hold, Count, Repeat
For how long should we hold each stretch? How often should we stretch? For how long should we stretch?
These are the  most commonly asked questions when discussing the topic of stretching. Although there are conflicting responses to these questions, it is",,,,,
"my  professional  opinion,  that  through  a  study  of  research  literature  and personal experience, I believe what follows is currently the most correct and beneficial information.
The  question  that  causes  the  most  conflict  is:  For  how  long  should  I  hold each  stretch?  For  Static  and  Passive  stretching,  some  text  will  say  that  as little as ten seconds is enough. This is a bare minimum. Ten seconds is only just enough time for the muscles to relax and start to lengthen. For any real improvement to flexibility, each stretch should be held for at least twenty to thirty seconds.
The   time   committed   to   stretching   should   be   relative   to   the   level   of involvement in our particular sport. So, for people looking to  increase  their general level of health and fitness, a minimum of about twenty seconds will be  enough.  However,  if  involved  in  high  level  competitive  sport  we  need  to hold each stretch for at least thirty seconds and start to extend that to sixty seconds and beyond.
How  often  should  I  stretch?  The  same  principle  of  adjusting  the  level  of commitment to the level of involvement in our sport applies to the number of times  we  should  stretch  each  muscle  group.  For  example,  the  beginner should stretch each muscle group two to three times. However, if involved at a  more  advanced  level,  we  should  stretch  each  muscle  group  three  to  five times.
For how long should I stretch? The same principle applies. For the beginner, about   five   to   ten   minutes   is   enough,   and   for   the   professional   athlete, anything  up  to  two  hours.  If  we  are  somewhere  between  the  beginner  and professional adjust the time spent stretching accordingly.
Do not be impatient with stretching. Nobody can get fit in a couple of weeks, so do not expect miracles from a stretching routine. Looking long term, some muscle groups may need a minimum of three months of regular stretching to see any real improvement. So stick with it, it is well worth the effort.",,,,,
"Sequence
When starting a stretching program it is a good idea to start with a general range of stretches for the entire body, instead of just a select few. The idea of this  is  to  reduce  overall  muscle  tension  and  to  increase  the  mobility  of  the joints and limbs.
The  next  step  should  be  to  increase  overall  flexibility by  starting  to  extend the  muscles  beyond  their  normal  range  of  motion.  Following  this;  work  on specific   areas   that   are   tight   or   important   for   your   particular   sport. Remember,  all  this  takes  time.  This  sequence  of  stretches  may  take  up  to three months to see real improvement, especially if we have no background in agility based activities or are heavily muscled.",,,,,
"Limited  data  exists  on  what  order  individual  stretches  should  be  done  in. However,  some  researchers  have  suggested  designing  flexibility  training programs  that  start  with  the  core  muscles  of  the  stomach,  sides,  back  and neck,  and  then  work  out  to  the  extremities.  Others  have  recommended starting  with  sitting  stretches,  because  there  is  less  chance  of  accidental injury while sitting, before moving on to standing stretches.
The exact order in which individual stretches are done is not the main point of  emphasis;  the  main  priority  is  to  cover  all  the  major  muscle  groups  and their  opposing  muscles,  and  to  work  on  those  areas  that  are  most  tight  or more important for your specific sport.
Once we have advanced beyond improving overall flexibility and are working on improving the range of motion of specific muscles, or muscle groups, it is important to isolate those muscles during the stretching routines. To do this, concentrate  on  only  one  muscle  group  at  a  time.  For  example,  instead  of trying to stretch both hamstrings at the same time, concentrate on only one at a time. Stretching this way will help to reduce the resistance from other supporting muscle groups.",,,,,
"Posture
Posture, or alignment, while stretching is one of the most neglected aspects of flexibility training. It is important to be aware of how crucial it can  be to the  overall benefits of stretching.  Poor posture and incorrect  alignment  can cause  imbalances  in  the  muscles  that  can  lead  to  injury.  While  proper posture will ensure that the targeted muscle group receives the best possible stretch.
In many instances one  major muscle  group can be  made up of a number of different muscles. If posture is poor or incorrect certain stretching exercises may put more emphasis on one particular muscle within that muscle group, thus causing an imbalance that could lead to injury.
The   picture   on   the   right,   for example,   shows   the   difference between  good  posture  and  poor posture     when     stretching    the hamstring  muscles  (the  muscles at the back of the upper legs).
During      this      stretch      it      is important    to    keep    both    feet pointing   straight   up.   Allowing the feet to fall to one side will put more  emphasis  on one  particular
part of the hamstrings, which could result in a muscle imbalance.",,,,,
,,,,,
Note  the  athlete  on  the  left;  feet  upright  and  back  relatively  straight.  The athlete on the right is at a greater risk of causing a muscular imbalance that may lead to injury.,,,,,
"How to use stretching as part of the warm-up
Lately,  I  have  been  receiving  a  lot  of  questions  referring  to  recent  studies and research findings about stretching. The most common question I receive concerns the role that stretching plays as part of the warm-up procedure.
Currently,   there   seems   to   be   a   lot   of   confusion   about   how   and   when stretching  should  be  used  as  part  of  the  warm-up,  and  some  people  are under the impression that stretching should be avoided altogether.
This  is  a  very  important  issue  and  needs  to  be  clarified  immediately.  The following   information   is   provided   to   dispel   some   common   myths   and misconceptions about stretching and its role as part of the warm-up.",,,,,
"What has science got to say?
Most of the studies I have reviewed attempt to determine the short term, or one-off effects of stretching on injury prevention. This is a mistake in itself and shows a lack of understanding as to how stretching is used as part of  a conditioning or injury prevention program.",,,,,
"Stretching  and  its  effect  on  physical  performance  and  injury  prevention  is something that just can not be measured scientifically. Sure we can measure the effect of stretching on flexibility with simple tests like the Sit and Reach Test,  but then to  determine  how that effects athletic performance  or injury susceptibility is very difficult, if not near impossible. One of the more recent studies  on stretching  supports  this  view  by  concluding;  Due to the paucity, heterogeneity   and   poor   quality   of   the   available   studies   no   definitive conclusions can be drawn as to the value of stretching for reducing the risk of exercise-related injury.1
To put the above quote in layman's terms; there has not been enough studies done  and  the  studies  that  have  been  done  are  not  specific  or  consistent enough.",,,,,
"1   Weldon,  SM.  The  efficacy  of  stretching  for  prevention  of  exercise-related  injury:  a  systematic review of the literature. Manual Therapy, 2003 Volume 8, Issue 3, Page 141.",,,,,
"The greatest misconception
Confusion  about  what  stretching  accomplishes,  as  part  of  the  warm-up procedure,  is  causing  many  to  abandon  stretching  altogether.  The  key  to understanding   the   role   stretching   plays   can   be   found   in   the   previous sentence; but you have to read it carefully.",,,,,
"Stretching, as part of the warm-up!
Here is the key: Stretching is a critical part of the warm-up, but stretching is NOT the warm-up.
Do not make the mistake of thinking that doing a few stretches constitutes a warm-up.   An   effective   warm-up   has   a   number   of   very   important   key elements, which all work together to minimize the likelihood of sports injury and prepare the individual for physical activity.
Identifying the components of an effective and safe warm-up, and executing them in the correct order is critical. Remember, stretching is only one part of an effective warm-up, and its place in the warm-up procedure is specific and dependant on the other components.
The  four  key  elements  that  should  be  included  to  ensure  an  effective  and complete warm-up are:
1.     The general warm-up: This phase of the warm-up consists of 5 to 15 minutes  of  light  physical  activity.  The  aim  here  is  to  elevate  the heart  rate  and  respiratory  rate,  increase  blood  flow  and  increase muscle temperature.
2.     Static  stretching:  Next,  a  few  minutes  of  gentle  static  stretching should   be   incorporated   into   the   general   warm-up   to   gradually lengthen all the major muscle groups and associated  soft tissues of the body.
3.     The sports specific warm-up: During this phase of the warm-up, 10 to 15 minutes of sport specific drills and exercises should be used to prepare the athlete for the specific demands of their chosen sport.",,,,,
"4.     Dynamic  stretching:  Lastly,  the  warm-up  procedure  should  finish with  a  number  of  dynamic  stretching  exercises  that  mimic  the common movements of the  sport or activity to follow. For example, arm  rotations  for  swimming,  or  swing  kicks  for  running  sports. Remember, the  force  of the bounce or swing is gradually increased but should never become radical or uncontrolled.",,,,,
"All   four   parts   are   equally   important   and   any   one   part   should   not  be neglected or thought of as not necessary. All four elements work together to bring the body and mind to a physical peak, ensuring the athlete is prepared for the activity to come.",,,,,
"Please note the following points
1.     Dynamic  stretching  carries  with  it  an  increased  risk  of  injury  if used  incorrectly.  Refer  to  chapter  4  for  more  information  about dynamic stretching.
2.     The  time  recommendations  given  in  the  above  warm-up  procedure relate  specifically  to  the  requirements  of  a  serious  athlete.  Adjust the   times   accordingly  if   your   athletic   participation   is   not  of  a professional manner.
3.     Recent  studies  have  indicated  that  static  stretching  may  have  a negative  effect  on  muscle  contraction  speed  and  therefore  impair performance  of  athletes  involved  in  sports  requiring  high  levels  of power  and  speed.  It  is  for  this  reason  that  static  stretching   is conducted  early  in  the  warm-up  procedure  and  is  always  followed by  sports  specific  drills  and  dynamic  stretching.  Recent  studies suggest  no  detrimental  effects  when  static  stretching  is  conducted early in the warm-up.2",,,,,
"What conclusions can we make?
Stretching  is  beneficial,  when  used  correctly.  Remember,  stretching  is  just one  important  component  that  assists  to  reduce  the  risk  of  injury  and improve athletic performance. The best results are achieved when stretching is   used   in   combination   with   other   injury   reduction   techniques   and conditioning exercises.",,,,,
"2   Taylor,  KL.  Sheppard,  JM.  Lee,  H.  Plummer,  N.  Negative  effect  of  static  stretching  restored when  combined  with  a  sports  specific  warm-up  component.  Journal  of  Science  and  Medicine  in Sport, 2009 Nov; 12(6):657-61.",,,,,
Chapter 7 Flexibility Testing,,,,,
"To  really  take  advantage  of  the  many  benefits  of  stretching,  a  record  of flexibility should be kept. For sports trainers and coaches in particular, it is vitally important to test and chart an athletes’ flexibility on a regular basis. This is important for two reasons.
Firstly,  it  provides  a  starting  point  from  which  to  measure  improvements and gives an indication of any areas that may be weak, limited or inflexible.
Secondly, in the event of an injury, this baseline flexibility provides a goal to achieve  before  resuming  exercise  or  returning  to  competition.  It  is  vitally important  that  flexibility  is  regained  after  an  injury.  Therefore  having  a record of what the level of flexibility was before the injury is very useful as a target to achieve.
During  the  year  set  a  minimum  standard  of  flexibility  for  the  activities engaged  in.  If  an  athlete  becomes  injured,  it  should  be  the  goal  to  achieve the   minimum   standard   of   flexibility   required   for   that   activity   before returning to exercise, competition or strenuous training.",,,,,
"What follows is a brief example of a few basic flexibility tests. These are the most commonly used tests but they are by no means the only ones. If  more are required, consult a professional sports trainer for ideas about tests that are  specific  to  the  athletes’  particular  sport.  Remember  The  Rules  for Safe Stretching in chapter 5 and once a test is used it is important not to vary it in any way. It must be kept the same each time it is used.
All   the  following  tests   are  best  done   using  a   goniometer;   a  devise   for measuring body limb angles. If a goniometer  is not available,  any standard 360 degree protractor will give a good indication of the angle at a particular joint.",,,,,
,,,,,
"Sit and Reach Test
The sit and reach test is probably the   most   common   test   used   to measure  flexibility  in  the  back, hips and hamstring muscles.",,,,,
Sit  on  the  floor  with  your  legs straight     and     your     feet     flat,,,,,
"against  an  upright  board.  Bend  forward  reaching  towards,  or  as  far  past, your  toes  as  possible,  and  then  record  the  distance  reached.  This  test  will give a good indication of hamstring, hip and back flexibility.",,,,,
"Shoulder Flexibility Test
Unfortunately,  participants  in  sports  such  as  swimming,  tennis  (or  any racket sport), any of the throwing events in athletics and especially contact sports,   are   extremely   susceptible   to   injuries   of   the   shoulder.   Shoulder flexibility should be a prime concern for anyone participating in these sports.
Start by standing upright with the hand pointing down. In this position the hand represents the 0 degree position.
Then raise the arm directly forward and above the  head,  as  in  the  picture  to  the  right.  Its furthest  point  is  then  recorded.  An  average acceptable  reading  of  180  degrees  is  expected for athletes.",,,,,
,,,,,
"Now move the arm down and behind the back to its furthest position, as in the picture to the right. This measurement is recorded and should exceed 50 degrees.",,,,,
,,,,,
,,,,,
"Hamstring Flexibility Test
Lie  on  the  ground  face  up,  with arms straight beside the body, as in  the  picture  below.  Raise  one leg  as  far  up  as  possible.  Keep the leg straight and measure the angle at the hip joint. An angle of 90  degrees  is  considered  average
to good.",,,,,

"Chapter 8
135 Unique Stretching Exercises",,,,,
"In   this   second   half   of   the   book   there   are   135   photographs   of   unique stretching exercises, each with an accompanying description explaining how the  stretch  is  performed.  These  stretching  exercises  are  not  specific  to  any particular sport or any particular type  of person. Of course  all  of them  will not be relevant to everyone, but a great number of them will be suitable for most athletes, coaches, trainers and health care professionals.",,,,,
"If you find a particular stretch difficult to  perform, start with the stretches that are more comfortable for you, and return to the more difficult stretches when your flexibility has improved.
An index is included on page 44 to assist in finding individual stretches, and each stretch has been arranged to correspond with a particular body part or major   muscle   group.   For   example,   when   looking   for   stretches   for   the shoulders, look to that particular heading. The stretches have been arranged so as to start with the neck and work down to the ankles and feet.
On  the  following  two  pages  there  are  anatomical  diagrams  of  the  major muscles of the body, and at the beginning of each section there is a list of the individual   muscles   that   the   stretches   target.   By   matching   the   list   of individual  muscles  at  the  beginning  of  each  section,  with  the  anatomical diagrams  on  the  next  two  pages,  you  can  see  exactly  which  muscles  are being stretched during each stretching exercise.",,,,,
"For  a  more  comprehensive  explanation  of  the  muscle  anatomy  involved during  each  of  the  stretching  exercises,  please  refer  to  The  Anatomy  of Stretching at www.AnatomyOfStretching.com.",,,,,
"Important!
Remember to always follow The Rules for Safe Stretching in chapter 5, and if  you  have  any  pre-existing  injuries  or  ailments  please  consult  a  sports doctor or physical therapist before attempting any of the following stretches. Discontinue any exercise that causes pain or severe discomfort and consult a medical expert.",,,,,
